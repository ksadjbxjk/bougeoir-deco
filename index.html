    <h2>What is a candle holder?</h2>
    <p>A candle holder is a decorative piece that holds a candle in place. It can come in different shapes, sizes, and materials, such as glass, metal, or ceramic. Candle holders are designed to protect surfaces from dripping wax and to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the candle.</p>
    
    <h2>Main differences</h2>
    <p>One of the main differences between candle holders and candlesticks is their function. While candle holders serve to protect surfaces and enhance the appearance of the candle, candlesticks elevate the candle for a more dramatic effect. Candlesticks are often used for formal occasions or special events, while candle holders are more versatile for everyday use.</p>
    <p>Additionally, candle holders are generally more compact and can only hold a single candle, while candlesticks are taller and can accommodate multiple candles. Due to their size, candlesticks are often used as central decorative pieces in a room in the house.</p>
    <p>Candlesticks also tend to have a more traditional and classic design, making them a popular choice for formal table settings or for candelabra decoration.</p>
    <p>In terms of cost, candlesticks are much more expensive than candle holders which are available in smaller formats.</p>
    
    <h2>The candlestick holder: a mix of the two</h2>
    <p>The candlestick candle holder is a perfect option if you are looking for an accessory that condenses the characteristics of both objects.</p>
    <p>Indeed, a candlestick holder has the compact size of a candle holder and the branch design of a classic candlestick. And all at a more affordable price than a traditional candlestick. What more could you ask for?</p>
    
    <h2>In conclusion</h2>
    <p>Candle holders and candlesticks each have their own charm and utility. Whether you prefer the simplicity of a candle holder or the grandeur of a candlestick, both options can add warmth and style to any space.</p>
